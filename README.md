# Sudoku

Created an algorithm to create a 4 by 4 sudoku and the nsolve it. This project helped me learn JavaScript and become fond with the language. It also hjelped me learn how to use node.js well, and how to interact with the terminal.

The only isssue would be that there are 'undefined' messages which print between each of the visualised sudoku squares. They however do not cause any errors.
